            <h2>Miguel de Unamuno -- 1864-1936</h2>
            <p><img src="images/unamuno.jpg" width="" height="" style="border: 1px solid #999; float: left; margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;" align="left" alt="Miguel Unamuno" />
                We know that there was a close relationship between Miguel de Unamuno and
                Antonio Machado.  Although Machado's letters to Unamuno have been preserved,
                the letters from Unamuno were lost, quite possibly during the poet's tragic
                escape from Franco's army shortly before his death.  Because of this we do not
                know what Unamuno said in his letters to Machado, but we have an anecdotal
                account which reveals how he felt about the poet.  Miguel Pérez Ferrero
                describes an incident when Unamuno visited a café in Madrid where the Machado
                brothers had a <em>tertulia</em>, and upon arriving at the door he said:
                "I am here to greet the man with the shabbiest clothes and the purest soul
                of any person I know: Don Antonio Machado." [<a href="#foot1">1</a>]  In
                the biography of his brother, José Machado tells us that Unamuno hardly ever
                came to Madrid without making an effort to meet with Antonio and Manuel.  José
                also describes the last time they saw each other, and he tells us that there
                were few things which affected Antonio as deeply as the death of Unamuno, s
                hortly before the beginning of the Spanish Civil War.</p>
            <p>I have translated several of Unamuno's works on the subject of religion,
                starting with his essay "My Religion" ("<em>Mi religión</em>") which serves
                as an introduction to his religious thought and provides the foundation for
                everything he wrote on this subject.  Although Unamuno's religious poems
                express his basic philosophy of life, most have not been translated into English.
                I have therefore translated the poems dealing with religion from his first
                two books of poetry: <em>Poems (Poesías)</em> and <em>Rosary of Lyrical Sonnets
                    (Rosario de sonetos líricos)</em>, as well as <a href="translations/unamuno/san_manuel_bueno_martir.pdf"><em>Saint Manuel Bueno, the Martyr (San Manuel Bueno, Martir)</em></a>, and Unamuno's long meditation on
                the painting of the crucifixion by Diego de Velazquez:  <a href="unamuno_religious.html"><em>The Christ of Velazquez (El Cristo de Velázquez)</em></a>.  I have added some comments about my
                translation of poetry below.</p>

            <p>For this translation I have used Volume IV of Unamuno's <em>Complete Works</em>,
                published in 1999 by the Biblioteca Castro.  It is never easy, or simple,
                to translate poetry from one language to another, and the translation of
                Unamuno's poetry is especially difficult.  There are always certain idioms
                or expressions which do not have an exact equivalent in the second language.
                Then, there is Unamuno's poetic style of changing the word order with his
                frequent use of hyperbatons, as well as other alterations in the order of
                his words.  Finally, when Unamuno writes prose as well as poetry, he
                sometimes uses paradoxical or obscure language to make the reader think
                and, perhaps more importantly, to express his own uncertainty about the
                concepts he is expressing.  In all cases I have tried to create a translation
                which coincides as closely as possible with an understanding of Unamuno's
                intention.  In my translation of Unamuno's sonnets, as in my translation
                of Machado's poetry, I did not try to make the words rhyme, because to
                do that would have forced me to use words that strayed too far from the
                original meaning.</p>
            <p>Since I am translating Unamuno's religious poetry, I would like to say
                something about his attitude toward matters belief and unbelief.  As
                I have stated in my articles, although he struggled with doubts,
                Unamuno was more inclined to belief than non-belief.  Those critics
                who have considered him an atheist have perhaps been influenced by
                their own lack of religious faith.  In the poems I have translated,
                there are none--not even his paradoxical poem, "The Atheist's Prayer"
                ("La oración del ateo")--that express unbelief.  Some critics have
                felt that Don Manuel, the character from his novella, <em>Saint Manuel
                    Bueno Martyr (San Manuel Bueno Martir)</em>, the priest who lost his faith
                in God, is an example of Unamuno's lack of belief.  But the narrator
                of this story, Angela Carballino, is perhaps a better example of Unamuno's
                real state of mind.  At first, Angela does not question her religious
                beliefs, but when her brother, Lazaro, reveals that her beloved Don Manuel
                had lost his faith in God, she begins to doubt.  She asks herself: "Do I
                believe?"  However, by the end of the novella Angela has come to believe
                that Don Manuel and her brother, as Unamuno expresses it with a play on
                words: "died believing they did not believe in God, but while not believing,
                actually believing, in an active and resigned state of unhappiness."
                She adds that, "for some mysterious and unknowable purpose, God let
                them think they were unbelievers, but then, when they were face to face
                with death, perhaps they realized their mistake."  In his book,
                <em>The Life of Don Quijote and Sancho (La vida de Don Quijote y Sancho)</em>
                Unamuno has stated paradoxically that "only those who doubt can actually
                believe."  For most people, doubt has a negative connotation, but it
                is obvious that for Unamuno the opposite is true.  Since the person
                whose faith is not tempered by doubt is open either to fanaticism or
                to spiritual laziness, the feeling of doubt not only helps us keep an
                open mind, but it also helps us live and act with greater vitality.
                My translation of Unamuno's poetry has convinced me of the truth of
                these words.</p>
